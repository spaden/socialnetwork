 Website link:  http://159.65.154.90/     

 Just visit the above link to see the live version of the website. I hope you loved it.


 Languages used Html, Css, JavaScript, Php, Mysql, Bootstrap, Ajax.

  All the data is accessed through API'S thorugh Ajax calls.

  Built the website from scratch. It was easy for me to built this because of experience gained through my previous project.

  Enounterd few bugs but deployed it on the cloud with minimal bugs and clean user interface.

  Exclusive features of the website:
 

         1. Users can post any topic annonymously and even anyone who sees the post can upvote, downvote the post. (just like reddit but a lot of cool features)
          
         2. If anyone finds it offensive, any user is free to flag the post and reporting it. The post will invisible immediatley and the concerned department goes through the post and erradicates it or modifies it.

         3. Anyone can comment on the post annonymously, and they are even free to flag a comment if they find it irrelevant or offensive. No one goes through the comments again, it gets deleted immediately.
       
         4. Share your profile to know what people think about you. (Just like the popular Sarahah app, but in here users can permanently delete the link if they find it to stingy).

         5. A new type of group chat where no one holds the authority, let me get it this way. No one knows who's in the chat, any person with the group link can access the chat. Full annonymity.
 
         6. Built upon annonymity. "Give man a mask and he will tell you the truth." is the cliche we believe in.

         7. Couple rating feature under development, couldn't do any more since I have been coding for 2 days.
